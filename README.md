# Codecademy Project - Output random message

## Mixed Messages

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. __To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data.__

Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Project Objectives

* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer

### Languages used

* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML

### Content

This project consists of an Index.html file, prism.js and prism.css file.
the prism files are used to syle the *JS code* that is displayed on the site.

The index.html file contains the styles and scripts to make the site work in the head.

### What the site does

When you click the button marked "Inspire Me" the following happens:

1. Random string selected from array of quoteArray
2. Random string selected from authorArray
3. Random boolean selected from boolArray
4. Random integer generated between 1 and 754.
5. Random date calculated as current  year - random integer
6. Random strings, date and integer are returned to the blockquote.

You can view the JavaScript code used by selecting the drop down on the page.

I would welcome any suggestions or recomendations :)
